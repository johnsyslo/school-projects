# school-projects
This is a repository that contains many of the code projects I worked on for university courses. This README also links to external repositories for school projects that I have worked on.

## Index
The courses are listed in chronological order, with newer projects closer to the top.
You can find more information on each project's individual README.

### Web Development
This contains all the HTML projects and random bits I did in the class. Has lots of differnet things that we did in class, most of which is incomplete and done to passing standards. Hope you enjoy..<br>
